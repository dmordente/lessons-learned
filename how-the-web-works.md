How the Web Works
1. Your laptop computer has an OS/browser that connects to your home's wifi router, which is connected to a modem or your ISP
2. ISPs are able to connect to other ISPs, give you access to websites
3. To visit a website, you will access a DNS server, which converts a text/readable domain name (ie: www.nytimes.com) into an IP address
4. The IP address is a sequence of 4 to 6 numbers between 0 and 255. The IP address will send a request to the website
5. In return, the website will send back a packet of information along with additional files you'll download like images and style sheets

Websites often utilize both front-end and back-end software, each of which can serve important functions:

- Front-end software allows programmers to format, style, and create messaging/behaviors on their websites that make it easy/aesthetically feasible for users to interface with the website's content and functionality

- Back-end software helps assemble necessary pages, pulls information from databases, stores user information so that data is easy to maintain and access
