All new ventures require startup capital to design an initial product/site, conduct testing, and determine if initial work is enough for a (hopefully) successful launch.  However, most products/sites require significant updates after customers are able to start testing new features and identifying common patterns of use.  To speed up product launches and save initial capital, new ventures should consider collecting customer feedback and performing initial customer acceptance testing before a full functionality product or product-supporting website is available.  Instead, entrepreneurs could begin with one of the following:

* Initial “voice of customer” interviews 
* Simple screen mock ups (no connections)
* Click-through demonstrations (no/minimal code build) 
* Partial functionality prototype (with option for A/B testing)

Customers can provide crucial feedback on the ability to fill the need, ease of use, look and feel of layout, and prioritization of features long before a full scale prototype is ready for review.  By using these lean startup techniques, an entrepreneur incorporate high value feedback into earlier drafts/versions and reduce the amount of time and money spent of rework for failed concepts.
