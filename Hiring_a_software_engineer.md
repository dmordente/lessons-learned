OK, so you’ve decided you do need some software. The process of hiring a software engineer can be daunting, particularly for managers with little experience in the required technology. The below musings are some hopefully helpful tips and questions to ask when taking on a developer or a development team for your project.
Ultimately you want to be able to express the vision and key user stories for the project, without specifying the exact, all-encompassing functionality and design from the outset. A good developer should be given the leeway to contribute on design and functionality where necessary / expedient.
Some obvious ways of sounding out a would-be developer are by seeking references from developers you know you will be unable to hire. This might include attending conferences and speaking to key-note speakers who are experts in a particular programming language and ask for people they recommend. Doing this, and mentioning where you got a developer’s contact details will give you credibility in approaching your developer.
You can also seek out a developer’s previous direct reports to gauge their working style and interpersonal skills.
Ideally, you will find a programmer who not only has the skills necessary for the build, but has some personal inclination towards the project. This passion for the content will be a hugely useful asset.

It is also important to get a sense of the developer's approach to continuous improvement. Their familiarity with the concept of kaizen may be an important indicator here.

A good question to ask a would-be developer is actually to explain something complex to a lay person in clear terms.

Tips for Gaining credibility:

1.  Create your own github profile and ask to be looped-in to the development process in real time
2.  Be conversant in basic frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap)

Useful questions to ask:

1.	What [________] do you use?
2.	What compares to [__________]?
3.	Why [_________] over other offerings?

For each of the above blanks put in each of the following:

A.	Version control system
B.	Unit testing library
C.	Framework



These questions, whilst they may not be overly useful in terms of your own personal understanding of the developer’s way of working and specific skill sets, provide the manager with a way to gauge the developer’s intellectual curiosity, dedication and understanding. A good developer should be able to articulate their choice of, say, frameworks by giving specific instances of projects they have worked on where they found one particular feature helpful as opposed to competitor offerings. What you are looking for here is intellectual rigor; do not be alarmed if you do not fully understand their answer on a technical level.
