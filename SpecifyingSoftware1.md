Specifying software is a critical part of any software you are going to build.  The first lesson is that you shouldn’t specify software at all because you should only build software if it is totally necessary.  But if you determine that you must build software, it is important to provide your developers with the full vision and background of the project so they can correctly make the little decisions along the way, instead of having to go back to you all the time with questions.  

Also, it has been proven that incremental or agile development is better than providing all the details of the software up front, including every use-case possible.  One reason for this is that software development can take months, and even years, so something you tell a developer to do at the beginning when you are specifying all the features up front will not be recallable to the developers when they are looking at their notes six months down the line. 

There are also two best practices for how to exactly specify you software to developers.  In both practices, the person requesting the software writes down small use-case stories on Post-It notes for the developer to use when building the software.  This is different than providing the developers the full build using wireframes and walking them through every screen and flow from screen to screen.  

The first method is Connextra User stories.  In this practice, you write down short use stories on a post-it note in the format “As a [ROLE], I want to [FEATURE] so that [BENEFIT]”.  The second, and often better method, is Job Stories.  The format for this is “When [SITUATION], I want to [MOTIVATION] so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].
