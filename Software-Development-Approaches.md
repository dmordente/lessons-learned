Big Design Up Front (BDUF) is a linear approach to software development approach that requires the design to be completed before any work on implementation is started.  Each phase of software development is to be completed before moving on to the next.  For example, testing will not begin until the entire program has completed the development stage.  The hope is that less time will be spent going back to prior phases to fix bugs.

Kanban is a type of Agile approach to software development which aims to minimize waste and Work-in-Process by breaking down the software development process into small tasks.  Each task then goes through its own development process from start to finish, matching the amount of work in process with available capacity.  

Scrum is another type of Agile approach, in which the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called sprints that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence.
