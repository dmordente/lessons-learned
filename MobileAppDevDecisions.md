Mobile Application Development Decisions:

Since the majority of page views for many websites are already coming from mobile devices, there is a need to meet the mobile demand through a responsive website that is well positioned to accommodate views from a variety of device types, including desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. By using one of several front end frameworks to design a good web application, such as Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb, you can effectively build an attractive and highly responsive web solution. When evaluating the need to develop a mobile application, not simply a site, there are three main approaches, which range in levels of difficulty and time to launch. PhoneGap packages front end websites as an app for deployment to phone. If you are looking for better aesthetics and design, Titanium Appcelerator may be a better option for iOS and Android apps for enhanced look and feel. For superior performance, Native application is the preferred method of choice, which is built in the language of the phone.
